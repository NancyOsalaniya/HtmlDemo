					<p>
						Going to the hospital can be stressful. Patients and their loved ones might be worried about an illness, anxious about recovery times, or concerned about what a procedure will cost. Today more than ever, patients have a great number of choices to make about the type of medical care they receive. We know that patients need to have reliable and understandable information about the level of care our hospital provides in order to make the best decisions possible.
					</p>
 <br>
<ul>
<li>Safe: Avoiding injuries to patients from the care that is intended to help them.

<li>Effective: Providing services based on scientific knowledge and best practice.

<li>Patient-centered: Providing care that is respectful of and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs and values, ensuring that patients' values guide all clinical decisions.

<li>Timely: Reducing waits and sometimes harmful delays for both those who receive and provide care.

<li>Efficient: Avoiding waste, including waste of equipment, supplies, ideas and energy.

<li>Equitable: Providing care that does not vary in quality because of personal characteristics such as gender, ethnicity, geographic location, and socio-economic status.
</ul>

		<center>&copy; Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. </center>
